1) augment_class_wise.py----> to augment just classes: 2, 5, 8 by augmentor library

2) data_load.py-------------> read file from train and test folder extract labels and preprocess input
			      I create a function to choose between different options for output data:
				1) just resize
				2) resize and preprocess
				3) resize and Upsample by SMOTE
				4) resize and Upsample and preprocess
				5) augment data (class-size)
3) Image_Preprocessing.py --> preprocess to reduce noise

4) raw_model.py-------------> raw model without any regularization

5) utils.py ---------------> utility functions

6) model_regularized.py----> regularized model

7) denoisingAE.py----------> try denoising AE for feature extraction (decoder output) !! not works

8) evaluation.py-----------> evaluation based on scikit learn

9) tryrandomforest.py------> check RF

10) try_with_tf_data_pipeline.py---> tf.data.Dataset pipeline

11) train.py---------------> for compile and fit
                              - get data from load_label (with different options)
			      - normalize(both) and shuffle(only train)
			      - choose between raw or regularized model
		              - compile and fit based on different options:
				   - normal fit
				   - fit by class weight
				   - fit by local loss
				   - kfoldCV
				   - based on ImageDataGenerator
12) InferenceClass.py------> as requested
